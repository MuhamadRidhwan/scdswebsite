    <p style={{ textAlign:'justify'}}>The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing in Data Science (SCDS) 2020 that will be held from 25 - 26 August 2020 (Venue: To be 
        Announced). With the advancement in computer technology, 
        data science plays an important role in various disciplines including bio-informatics, medical and health informatics, social sciences, manufacturing, economics, 
        business and finance. SCDS2020 aims to provide 
        a platform for discussions on leading edge methods and also addressing challenges, problems and issues in soft computing in data science and analytics. The role of 
        soft computing in data science is significantly 
        increasing in every field from engineering to life sciences and with advanced computer technology, solutions for complex real problems can be simplified. For the 
        advancement of society in the 21st century, there 
        is a need to transfer knowledge and technology to industrial applications to solve real-world problems. SCDS2020 have invited renowned international and local keynote 
        speakers who are academia or practitioners to 
        share their knowledge and experience in the area of soft computing in data science. 
    </p>
